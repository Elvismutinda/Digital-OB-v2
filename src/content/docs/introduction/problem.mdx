Crime in Kenya especially in cities has been on the rise. With this increase in crime, it is high time that the
department of internal security should incorporate modern ways of crime management which calls for the use of a
Crime Management System. The existing system involves tedious manual inputs such as reporting complaints,
taking actions against crimes and viewing case status'.
All of these are done manually posing problems such as an ever-increasing paper load, time wastage, difficulty
in access control as well as cases of missing files and information. Therefore, drawbacks of the existing system
can be concluded as follows:

1. Manual entries which lead to time-consuming processes and errors in the entries.
2. Missing files containing criminal reports. This could be due to misplacement of files or those in charge compromising the integrity of the recorded incidents.
3. Limited accessibility to authorized personnel across multiple locations.
4. Extraction of meaningful insights from the recorded data due to lack of proper reporting and analysis tools.

These challenges and more in police service are the guiding factors that helped in coming up with the proposed system.
