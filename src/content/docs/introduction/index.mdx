Crime is present in all societies of all types and since time immemorial, it has increased
everywhere globally. Currently, advanced as well as developing countries have a growing problem
of crime and delinquency (Reckless C, 1973). The magnitude of the problem is registered in
increased public concern about safety of individuals and property, the current escalation of
offenses which manage to escape detection in a fluid world, the growing willingness of victims'
observers to report criminal deeds to the police, owing to the development of communication
technology, the state of greater police coverage in every populated area and even attention
given to criminal activities by news media.

It is no longer a controversy that we live in a globalized world characterized by fast information
transfer across large geographic areas by means of the internet. Many systems so far have been
developed in Kenya in relation to security issues, for example, closed-circuit televisions (CCTV)
have been put into place to assist the police in on-screen crime detection.

Many police stations still rely on traditional law enforcement methods in their day-to-day operations.
With the growth of technology and the internet, criminals have found new ways to exploit
vulnerabilities in traditional law enforcement methods, and the sheer volume of data available to
law enforcement agencies has made it difficult to identify and prioritize cases.

The crime management system (CMS) is a comprehensive approach to managing criminal activities.
It is a computerized system that will enable law enforcement agencies and government agencies to
collect, store and analyze crime data to enhance their ability to prevent and respond to criminal
activities swiftly.

The overall objective of this proposal is to develop a web application that is sufficient to
automate the police information of criminal cases reported.
