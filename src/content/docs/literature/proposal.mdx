Research has shown that crime management systems all around the world have a significant impact on crime reduction
and prevention. A study by Njenga et al. (2020) found that the implementation of a crime management system in
Nakuru led to 30% reduction in crime over a two-year period. Other studies have also shown that it can help reduce
response times, increase clearance rates and improve the overall efficiency and effectiveness of law enforcement.

The aim of our system is to help law enforcement deal with criminal activities in a more efficient way by keeping
track of criminal records and creating a criminal reporting application in case of any suspicious activities noted
by civilians.
