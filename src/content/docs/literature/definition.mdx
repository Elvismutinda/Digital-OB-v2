A crime is any act or omission prohibited by the law for the protection of the public and made punishable by state
in a judicial proceeding in its own name. It is a public wrong as distinguished from a mere private wrong or civil
injury to an individual (Marshall L, 1999). There are many different types of crimes, from crimes against persons
to victimless crimes. These are discussed below.
