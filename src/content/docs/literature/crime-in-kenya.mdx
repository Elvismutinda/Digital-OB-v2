### 1. Theft and Banditry

Pickpockets and thieves carry out “snatch and run” crimes on city streets and near crowds (Google Inc. 2013). 
Thieves routinely snatch electronic devices and other objects from open vehicle windows while motorists are either 
stopped at traffic lights or in heavy traffic. Thieves on matatus, buses and trains may steal valuables from 
inattentive passengers. Many scams perpetrated against unsuspecting tourists are prevalent in and around the city 
of Nairobi. Many of these involve people impersonating police officers and using fake police ID badges and other 
credentials.

### 2. Political Crime

In 2006, it was estimated the average urban Kenyan pays 16 bribes per month. There is also corruption on a larger 
scale with each of the last two government regimes being criticized for their involvement. There is supposed to be 
freedom of speech and expression in Kenya, but the authorities continue take it away by trying to intimidate 
journalists, bloggers and other influential members of the civil society.

### 3. Terrorism

At the urging of the Al-Shabaab militant group, a significant and increasing number of terrorist attacks in Kenya 
have been carried out by local Kenyans, many of whom are recent converts to the unpopular cult. Estimates in 2012 
placed the figure of Kenyan fighters at around 10% of Al-Shabaab's total forces (Google Inc. 2013). Referred to as 
the "Kenyan Mujahideen" by Al-Shabaab's core members, the converts are typically young with poverty making them 
easier targets for the outfit's recruitment activities.
