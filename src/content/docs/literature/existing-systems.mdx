The County Government of Nakuru launched a community-based crime monitoring and reporting system in 2015 called
`Mulika Uhalifu`. The system enabled the public to report crime cases through the SMS code 988 at a free of charge
SMS charge. The text was then forwarded immediately to 5 security chiefs in your county namely; The County
Commissioner, The County Police Commander, The County Coordinating/County Administration Police Commander,
The County Criminal Investigator Officer, and National Intelligence Service.
