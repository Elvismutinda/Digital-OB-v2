### 1. Crimes against Persons

Also known as personal crimes. These include murder, aggravated assault, rape, and robbery. Personal crimes
are unevenly distributed in not only Kenya but also the rest of the world, with young, urban, poor minorities
committing these crimes more than others (United Nations Report, 2007).

### 2. Crimes against Property

Also known as property crime. This involves theft of property without body harm, for example, burglary, motor
vehicle theft, and arson. Like personal crimes, young, urban, poor minorities generally commit these crimes more
than others.

### 3. Crimes against Morality

Crimes against morality are also called victimless crimes because there is no complaint or victim. Prostitution,
illegal gambling and illegal drug use are all examples of victimless crimes.

### 4. White-Collar Crimes

This is a crime committed by people of high social status who commit these crimes in the context of their occupation.
Examples are the pyramid schemes of 2006 and the Anglo-Leasing which cost the individuals and the country large sums
of money. This includes embezzling (stealing money from one's employer), insider trading and tax evasion and other
violations of income tax laws.

White-collar crimes generally generate less concern in the public mind than other types of crime, however in terms
of economic effort, white-collar crimes are even more consequential for the society.

### 5. Organized Crime

This is crime committed by structured groups typically involving the distribution of illegal goods and services to
others.

A key sociological concept in the study of organized crime is that these industries are organized along the same
lines as legitimate businesses and take on a corporate form. There are typically senior partners who control the
business' profits, workers who manage and work for the business, and clients who buy the goods and services that
the organization provides.
