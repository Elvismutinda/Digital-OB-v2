In order to gather the required functionalities that the system should offer and how to manage it efficiently, I
got in touch with a police officer at Central Police Station, Nairobi, and had a conversation with a friend whom had once
reported a crime at Parklands Police Station and got to see how the digital O.B system works and some of its
challenges.

### Methods used

1. Interviews.
2. Online research.

#### Findings

The OCS is the one in charge of the police station as well as the O.B. When someone goes to report an incident at
the police station, they are given an OB Number as per the nature of their report.

For example, we could have the complaint below:

<Image

  width="518"
  height="100"
  alt="logo"
/>

In the figure above, the nature of report is `Obtaining money by false pretense` and O.B. No. is `42/30/08/2018`
meaning that it is the 42nd time obtaining money by false pretense has been reported at Parklands Police Station.
The series of numbers and slashes following represent the date the crime was reported at the station.

From this we can say that the O.B is a complete record of reports of incidents, crimes, complaints and also a sort
of inventory of all the suspects and the accusations against them.

### Functional Requirements

#### 1. User Login

This feature is used for 3 types of users (Admin, Police and Criminal Investigation Officer) to login into the system.
Where client in this case can be undercover police agents. They are required to key in their staff ID and password
before they are granted permission to access the system. The staff ID and password will be verified to prevent
unauthorized personnel from accessing the system. All users are registered by the admin who gives them a unique
staff ID that the system will identify them by.

#### 2. Validate And authenticate user

This feature ensures that the system user's identities are protected accordingly by validating and authenticating
the user login details.

#### 3. Register a new user

This feature is used by the admin and in-charge officer to register new system users (staff). The system ensures
that the information supplied by the admin and in-charge officer is of the correct form through the input type of
the registration form.

#### 4. Edit or Delete Information

This feature allows the system users to edit and delete information from the system based on their privileges.
For example, only the admin user can edit and delete the records of other users in the system database. Admin
selects the particular user from the records to view the details to be edited. The system responds by displaying
the details that can be edited. The admin then edits the records as required and updates. The admin is also able
to delete user data from the `users` system database table. The system must then inform the admin of the update
success once the record has successfully been updated (edit or delete).

#### 5. Add station

This feature allows the admin to add stations in the system. Once the police station details have been added to the
system database, the admin is also able to edit the details and delete the station from the system database.

#### 6. Add complainant

This feature allows the system user (police) to add a complaint into the system database. Here, the complainant
details are recorded into the database.

#### 7. Add Case

Once the complainant details are recorded, a new case is created from the details recorded and they are saved in the
system databases.

#### 8. Add Suspect

This feature allows the police to add a suspect into the system database if there is any connection to a reported
case.

#### 9. Assign Case

This feature allows the in-charge officer or police officer of a certain police station to assign a case to an
investigating officer present in their station. The investigating officer can view the cases assigned to them.

#### 10. Generate Report

The system should be able to generate reports about the victim, suspect and the crime committed.

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### 1. Usability Requirements

The system must be designed with a user-friendly interface and easy to use by all users so that they can perform
their tasks easily.

#### 2. Security requirements

The system authentication protocol and access control must be highly secured when logging into the system.
Passwords are encrypted and hashed using MD5 function. This is because some privileges are only meant for the
system administrator., meaning if the security is compromised, the whole system is compromised.

#### 3. Reliability requirements

The system must perform accurately towards the user's requests. For example, when a system user saves edited
details, when they review the details later, they must be changed accordingly to the latest details that was
updated.

#### 4. Error handling

An appropriate error message should be displayed to guide the user on how to recover from an error in case they run
into one.

### Technical Requirements

> **Note**:
> These requirements are for the new Digital O.B version (the one on this site).
> Also these might not be so accurate. Just my guess.

#### 1. Server-Side Requirements Specification

Keep in mind the application stores a large amount of crime data.

| Hardware  |         | Software         |                      |
| --------- | ------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |

|           |         | Operating system | Linux or Windows     |

#### 2. Client-Side Requirements Specification

| Hardware            |         | Software         |                      |
| ------------------- | ------- | ---------------- | -------------------- |
