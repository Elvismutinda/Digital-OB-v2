### Waterfall Development Methodology

The Waterfall Model involves fully completing the activities of a phase before proceeding to the next phase. 
It is basically used for small projects with no uncertain requirements like for the Crime Management System. 
At the end of each phase, a review takes place to determine if the project is on the right path. In this model, 
the testing starts only after the development is complete.

Below is an illustration of the Waterfall Development Model:

#### 1. System Planning

In this phase which was the first step was to identify needs for the digital OB management system. It entailed 
determining the necessary information required for the system to be fully operational as well as function in the 
expected manner.

#### 2. System Analysis

In this phase, I analyzed and considered the current system and investigated any problems associated with it. 
Other sources of information about the system and the new requirements were also investigated at this time. 
The information gathered in the planning phase was highly used in this phase and analyzed for the design stage.

#### 3. System Design

After analyzing the necessary requirements, the design of the information flow was done to show the logical 
structure of the system. The system's architecture was designed and the detailed design of the system's 
components was created (hardware and software requirements, data flow diagrams, data models and user interface design). 
Use cases, context diagrams and entity relationship diagrams were developed in this phase to show the connection 
that will exist between one user to another

#### 4. System Coding and Implementation

After the design of the interfaces as well as the indication of information flow through the sequence diagrams, 
the next step was to develop code abstracting the functionality of the system to realize the already fore-mentioned 
set objectives. The code was in relation to the information flow and therefore the flowcharts developed were applied 
here. The requirements documentation was referred throughout the rest of the system development process to ensure 
the developing project aligns with the needs and requirements or scope.

#### 5. System Testing

Testing then followed to determine if the intended objectives were met. Function testing was done to determine 
whether the system was working as it was expected to. User testing was carried 

#### 6. Deployment of system

Once testing was done and the system had passed all validations and verifications, it was then termed to be 
acceptable and end-users should be trained on how to use it.
